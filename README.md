# IPALine
A simple shell script which allows you to compile an APP (.app) file to an IPA (.ipa), without the use of any packages
<br><br><br>

## Installation

To install IPALine on Linux, macOS, or Windows, download the shell script using curl:
```
curl 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BrianWalczak/IPALine/main/main.sh' -o ./IPAline.sh
```

<br>

Next, make the shell script executable by running chmod
```
chmod u+x IPAline.sh
```

<br>

Lastly, run the shell script by executing IPAline.sh
```
sudo sh IPAline.sh
```

<br>

The application will ask for the following 3 items:
- The name of the iOS App
- The path to the APP (.app) file
and
- The path to save the IPA in
