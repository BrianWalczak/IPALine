# IPALine
A simple shell script which allows you to compile an APP (.app) file to an IPA (.ipa), without the use of any packages
<br><br><br>

## Installation/Usage

To install IPALine on Linux, macOS, or Windows, download the shell script using curl and run it using bash:

```
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BrianWalczak/IPALine/master/main.sh)
```

The application will ask for the following 3 items:
- The name of the iOS App
- The path to the APP (.app) file
and
- The path to save the IPA in

### Follow the prompts and that's it! Thanks for using IPALine
