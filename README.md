## Installation/Usage

To install IPALine on Linux, macOS, or Windows, open up the shell script at `main.sh`

Copy all of the contents, and paste it in the terminal. Then press enter to run the commands

The application will ask for the following 3 items:
- The name of the iOS App
- The path to the APP (.app) file
and
- The path to save the IPA in
